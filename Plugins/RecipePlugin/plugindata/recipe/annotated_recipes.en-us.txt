[note]The Ducasse method works best on thick steaks, at least 2 inches.[/note] [note]The whole idea is instead of searing quickly at high heat (potentially charring the meat), the sear is slowly done on low heat (browning instead of charring).[/note] \r\n\r\n[note]The most important thing about cooking any protein is to make sure it is at room temperature when it hits the pan.[/note] [note]Otherwise it's chewy.[/note]\r\n\r\n[step]The first step is cooking the [ingredient]steaks[/ingredient] on their sides over medium heat, where there's a thick strip of fat.[/step] [step]This renders down the beef fat into a liquid, allowing the steak to cook in it's own juices.[/step] [step]This reenforces the beef flavor, which really came out in the finished product.[/step] [step]This is where having a thick steak comes in handy, as it sat nicely on its side.[/step]\r\n\r\n[step]After about 5 minutes on the fat side, it's flipped over to cook the other side.[/step] [step]There isn't much fat to render there so it isn't required, but gives the side a more appealing look.[/step]\r\n\r\n[step]Now that the sides are cooked I start cooking the bottom side, still on medium heat.[/step] [step]At this point I add half a stick of [ingredient]butter[/ingredient], along with [ingredient]garlic[/ingredient], [ingredient]onion[/ingredient], and [ingredient]thyme[/ingredient].[/step] [step]Every minute or so I tip the pan and baste the steaks with butter.[/step] [step]After about 10 minutes, they are ready to flip.[/step]\r\n\r\n[step]After about 10 minutes on one side, I flip and repeat.[/step] [step]10 minutes on medium heat, basting with [ingredient]butter[/ingredient] every minute.[/step] [step]Some say the butter needs to be replaced at this point to avoid burning, but mine seemed fine so I didn't.[/step]\r\n\r\n[step]After both sides are seared, the steaks are moved to a warm pan to rest.[/step] [step]This allows the juices, which have moved towards the surface of the meat, to redistribute themselves evenly.[/step] [note]The article suggests a resting time that's half the cooking time, so I waited 15 agonizing minutes before digging in.[/note]\r\n\r\n[note]I didn't want to let the delicious beef fat and butter go to waste, so I threw in some mushrooms while the steak was resting.[/note] [note]The steak was good enough to eat on its own, but these were a tasty addition![/note]\r\n\r\n[note]While this method is very time consuming, I've never tasted a steak like this before.[/note] [note]Even at fancy steakhouses you won't be able to find this, as they can't spend 45 minutes on each steak they cook.[/note] [note]The sear had so much more flavor than when done at a high heat, it was definitely worth the effort![/note] [note]Due to the high cooking time only thick steaks can be done medium rare, so I'll still be cooking thinner steaks with other methods.[/note] [note]But when it's time to treat yo'self and go big, this is the way to go![/note]

             * The 5 minutes issue is because your Sponsor which has to inherit from MarshalByRefObject also has an associated lease. 
             * It's created in your Client domain and your Host domain has a proxy to the reference in your Client domain. 
             * This expires after the default 5 minutes unless you override the InitializeLifetimeService() method in your Sponsor class or this sponsor has its own sponsor keeping it from expiring.
             *   Funnily enough, I overcame this by returning Null in the sponsor's InitializeLifetimeService() override to give it an infinite timespan lease, and I created my ISponsor implementation to remove that in a Host MBRO.

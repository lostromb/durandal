Preheat over to 350 degrees.\r\n\r\nIn a bowl, combine brown sugar and oil. Turn mixer to low speed and mix in eggs. Let the sugar, oil, and eggs mix while sifting together the flour, baking powder, soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Set flour mixture aside.\r\n\r\nIn another small bowl, mix vanilla into milk and set aside.\r\n\r\nBoil the water and pour over the cocoa and whisk it until smooth.\r\n\r\nTo the egg mixture, alternating add the flour mixture and milk mixture beginning and ending with flour. Scrape as needed. With mixture on low speed, add the cocoa, scrape down the sides and mix well at a low speed.\r\n\r\nBake in 3 ten-inch cake pans, or 3.5 dozen standard cupcakes. For cakes, line the bottom with parchment paper.\r\n\r\nBake 30 minutes for cakes or 15-17 minutes for cupcakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the frosting:\r\n\r\nMelt chocolate chips in a double boiler and set aside for 30 minutes to cool.\r\n\r\nCombine cocoa with the boiling water, stirring until the cocoa has dissolved.\r\n\r\nWhile the chocolate cools, use and electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, powdered sugar, and salt until pale and fluffy. Reduce speed to low and add the chocolate. Beat until well combined and sides scraped down. Beat in the cocoa mixture. Use at room temperature. Chill the frosting until it hardens as desired.
Preheat the oven to 400°F\r\nPeel the rutabagas and cut them into roughly 2" chunks; place them in a large mixing bowl.\r\nAdd the rest of the ingredients to a separate bowl and mix vigorously with a whisk until well combined.\r\nPour that sauce over the rutabagas and toss with a spoon until all the pieces are evenly coated.\r\nSpread the rutabaga in a single layer across a broiler pan, making sure there is plenty of room between the pieces of rutabaga to allow air to circulate freely.\r\nCover with aluminum foil and bake in the oven for 30 minutes, then remove the foil, lower the heat to 375°F and continue baking, stirring 2 or 3 times during the process, until the rutabaga is fork tender and starts to caramelize around the edges, about 25 minutes.\r\nOnce the rutabaga has reached the desired color and doneness, remove it from the oven and immediately hit it with a light sprinkle of salt. Let it cool for a few minutes and then serve, garnished with fresh herbs and a dribble of extra-virgin olive oil, if desired.
Mix all ingredients together. Put into 9x13 greased pan. Sprinkle corn flakes on top. Bake 350 degrees for 50 minutes.
1.	In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt until evenly mixed. Add the vegetable oil and stir until crumbly dough is formed. Set aside.\r\n2.	Place the spinach and warm milk in a blender, and blend on high until the mixture is smooth. Pour the spinach into the flour and stir to combine. If mixture is too wet, add a little bit more flour. Knead the dough with your hands for about 5 minutes, until smooth. Form the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\r\n3.	Lightly flour a work surface and a rolling pin. Break the chilled dough into 10-12 golf-ball sized balls. Roll each ball out into a very thin circle about 8 inches in diameter. The thinner the dough is, the more pliable the wrap will be. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. One at a time, cook the wraps in the dry frying pan, for about 30 seconds on each side or until wrap has stiffened slightly and is golden brown in spots. Let cool, then wrap in plastic wrap and store in the fridge until ready to use.\r\n\r\nMakes 10 - 12 wraps
Bake at 350 for 12-18 minutes.
Place rice in fine mesh colander.\r\nRinse well in several changes of water.\r\nThen, place rice in Instant Pot.\r\nAdd water, milk, maple syrup, and sea salt.\r\nStir briefly.\r\nThen, seal lid and close vent.\r\nNext press the Porridge button. The rice will take 20 minutes to cook on this setting. (For any other pressure cooker, this is the equivalent of cooking on high pressure for 20 minutes.)\r\nWhen the timer beeps, allow the pressure to release slowly for 10 minutes.\r\nAfter 10 minutes, press the Cancel button and open vent.\r\nWhen de-pressurized, open lid.\r\nAdd cream and vanilla.\r\nStir until well mixed.\r\nServe with optional toppings.
* I figure you don't need any photos of this. Cook the rice with about a cup and a half of the chicken broth, less than you would normally use. When the broth has been absorbed in 10-15 minutes the rice will still be undercooked. You want to make sure that the rice won't get mushy later on. \r\n\r\n    * Chop up the tomatos, onions, and parsley like so. Squeeze the tomatoes before chopping to get rid of most of their seeds and juices, and don't use any of extra juice in the can, you want everything to be as dry as possible. \r\n\r\n    * Fry the chopped onions in a tablespoon or so of the olive oil until translucent, and add the crumbled ground beef and plenty of salt and pepper. \r\n\r\n    * After the ground beef has cooked for a minute or two, add the tomatoes and parsley and stir it all together. Simmer uncovered for a few minutes before adding the rice. \r\n\r\n    * Add the rice and, stirring frequently, cook until the rice is done and the whole mixture is dry and beginning to stick to the bottom of the pan. Add more salt and pepper if necessary. Remove from the heat. At this point you could refrigerate some or all of the mixture to fry up later. In this case I went straight ahead and fried it all up. \r\n\r\n    * Toss everything into a wok in which a dab of peanut oil has been heated until it just starts to smoke. Lightly beat two eggs and pour that in as well. \r\n\r\n    * You want everything to get a nice browned crust on the bottom, a very hot wok and a dry mixture makes this possible. It's better if you don't overcook the eggs, but don't worry too much about this, the browned crust is the most important thing. If you mixture seems too wet, just let it brown a bit before adding the eggs. \r\n\r\n    * Serve in a white bowl on a white counter with a glass of white milk and some white parmesan cheese on top, and take a flash photograph!
Heat 2 tablespoons. olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add celery, onion, bell peppers, jalapeno and garlic. Saute for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft and mostly cooked. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, chicken and sausage, and stir to combine. Continue sauteing for an additional 5 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink and mostly cooked.\r\n\r\nAdd the chicken stock, tomatoes, rice, Cajun spice, bay leaf, thyme, and cayenne, and stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked, stirring occasionally. (Don't forget to stir, or the rice may burn on the bottom of the pan.)\r\n\r\nOnce the rice is tender, add in the shrimp and okra and stir to combine. Let the mixture continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are cooked and pink. Remove bay leaf and season the jambalaya with salt and pepper and hot sauce and additional Cajun/Creole seasoning if needed. Remove from heat and serve with optional garnishes if desired.\r\n\r\n*If you like spicy jambalaya, I recommend adding 2 jalapenos with their seeds in. If you like it mild, I'd go with just 1 seeded jalapeno. Or you can go somewhere in between, and always add extra hot sauce at the end if it's too mild.\r\n\r\n**I also like heavily seasoned jambalaya, so I go with a full 2 Tbsp. If you think that might be too much, I recommend adding just 1 Tbsp and then taste-testing the rice before adding the shrimp. If you want to add more at that point, just stir some extra seasoning in when you add the shrimp.
Mix spices and flour.\r\n\r\nMake eggwash by mixing buttermilk and egg.\r\n\r\nCoat chicken in eggwash and then dipin spice mix.\r\n\r\nDeep fry for 5 minutes at 350
Buy some foccacia, marinara sauce, pesto, and provolone. Cut the foccacia down the middle, and spread marinara sauce and pesto on both sides, then layer each side thinly with provolone. Bake at 350 for 10 minutes.
crust. Line a 9x13 with wax paper, throw your 2c flour, 1/2 sugar, 1tsp vanilla, 1/2 1tsp salt, and 2 sticks of cut up cold butter into a blender, or mixer.\r\nMake that shtuff look like sand, and flatten it down.  Use your hands, don't be a b-word.\r\nBake that crusty goodness for 20 min, and start working on that orgasm-inducing lemon filling.\r\nAdd the 1 and 3/4 cups of turbinado sugar. Add in that last stick of salty-ass butter. Add in your tbsp of olive oil.\r\nGrab those big juicy lemons\r\nAnd slice them nice, and slow. Try not to squeeze too much juice out, but please.... Remove the pits. Edit: Yes, use the whole lemon. You see that white pithy part? As long as it's not really thick, these will taste great. Don't waste time by doing it the old school way, just be brave, and use the whole damn fruit.\r\nThrow those slices in the blender, with 6 whole freaking eggs.\r\nReally... You need 6. Also, I've noticed that this recipe gets even better if you use less sugar in the batter. The original recipe that I found called for almost 3 cups. Tonight I used 1 and 3/4 cups, and this made the non-sweet eating BF to about have an accident.\r\nBlend that minute until is smooooooth, then add those 3 tbsp corn starch. Blend the HECK out of this.\r\nPull out that buttery crust that you made, with love and tenderness.\r\nAnd poke the hell out of it. Ohhh yeah.\r\nGrab your batter, baby!\r\nAnd slowly pour it all over yo' crust.\r\nBake at 350 freedoms for 33 mins. Pull it out, separate the bar from the wax paper with a knife, and take it out of the pan, slowly.\r\nGrab that last, crucial ingredient.  Confectioners sugar, baby! Try to find a small screen or sieve, we're gonna need it to dink with.\r\nGently...very gently pour some sugar in your screen/sieve, and get ready to dink.\r\nEvenly dink your liking on the bar. I used 2 of these amounts, or barely 2 passes.\r\nCut into 6 long pieces\r\nAnd now cut into 3 pieces horizontally.\r\n\r\nWow, most viral and FP while I was sleeping. Thanks, guys! Sorry about all the typos- It was late, there was vodka... I'm lazy. Hope y'all try this recipe, and yes, thanks to the commenters that helped out, it is 1 and 3/4 cup of sugar, or 1.75! Have a great day! Also, since I'm now at a computer, and not on mobile, here's the recipe in ounces! 16oz flour 2 large lemons 4oz and 14 oz turbinado sugar 3 sticks of salted butter 2 tsp vanilla1 tsp salt 6 large eggs 1.5oz corn starch 0.5oz olive oil
Boil water in a large pan/pot and cook the pasta until it’s al dente. Drain and then set aside for later.\r\n    In a large sauce pan, sauté the garlic in the melted butter and olive oil.\r\n    Add the wine to the sauce pan and let cook for about a minute.\r\n    Turn off the heat and add the pasta back into the pan.\r\n    In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, parmesan, capers, basil, and lemon zest then add the mixture to the pan. Stir to combine everything.\r\n    Give the cheese a minute or two to melt then serve and enjoy!
1. In a medium bowl, combine beef, egg, grated onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until combined. Form into thin patties.\r\n\r\n2. Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread.\r\n\r\n3. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook burgers about 3 minutes each side. Drain on paper towels. Drain grease from skillet.\r\n\r\n4. In same skillet, place 6 slices bread, butter side down. Top each with a slice of cheese, if desired, some onion slices, and a burger. Top with remaining slices cheese, if using, and bread, butter side up. Cook each sandwich until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.\r\n\r\nServe with mustard, ketchup, pickles, or any other desired hamburger toppings.
Chop crowns and stems off of broccoli. Combine all ingredients in a hot wok and set to boil in high heat. Cook uncovered at high for 13-15 minutes. Once all the water has evaporated it's done.
First, chop up your onion. Then, your four cloves of garlic. Remember, a clove is just a section of the bulb. Don’t do what my buddy did, and cut up four BULBS of garlic for this recipe. Good lord that was garlic-y!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, blend your cans of whole tomatoes separately in the blender, just until they’re sauce. If you like a really smooth sauce, you can blend them more. With one of the cans, add the tomato paste before you blend.\r\n\r\nSaute your onions and garlic with a little olive oil in your sauce pot over medium heat, stirring ocassionally. \r\n\r\nOnce the onions turn translucent, add the blended tomatoes. I got a little lax with my picture taking for the next bit, so here’s a general description.\r\n\r\nHeat the tomatoes-onion-garlic mixture over low to medium heat, stirring ocassionally. Add the oregano, basil, thyme, and rosemary to taste. Note: it will take more of these spices than you expect.\r\n\r\nThen, I take whatever wine we’re drinking that night and add a decent splash into the pot. Throw a pinch of sugar into the pot at this point as well, and stir well.\r\n\r\nCook for around 30-35 minutes over low heat, stirring ocassionally. It should lightly bubble and simmer during this time.
To make mashed potatoes, you cut raw potatoes into equal-size pieces (you can peel the potatoes or not), cover them with an inch of cold water, bring it to a boil and cook them until they can be easily pierced with a knife, then drain. Meanwhile heat some butter and cream (or milk, or half-and-half) together in another pot, combine that with the cooked potatoes and lots of salt and mash it all together. You can add more milk, butter, and salt until it tastes good if you need to. Lots of people add things like garlic, spices, sour cream, even cheese to the butter/cream mixture for extra deliciousness (like the restaurant-style garlic mashed potatoes recipe)
Blend together on low in a small blender pitcher.\r\n\r\nDrizzle in extra-light flavored olive oil. You'll add between 3/4 and 1 cup of oil before it firms up. Just keep adding it until it starts to get firm. If in doubt, hold the pitcher up sideways. If the mayo runs, keep adding more oil.\r\n\r\nIt keeps about a week in the fridge. It's better than anything you can buy in the store.
Heat oil on medium heat\r\nAdd scallions and garlic, cook, stirring frequently until scallions are soft (1 minute)\r\nStir in spiced and cook 30 seconds\r\nStir in beans until heated (3 mins)\r\nStir in cilantro, and top with cheese
Melt margarine and mix in cocoa. Allow to cool. Add honey, eggs, sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well. Add nuts. Pour batter into a greased 9-by-13 baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Cool.\r\nPrepare mint icing: Soften margarine. Add salt, corn syrup, and powdered sugar. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Add mint extract and food coloring. Mix. Add milk gradually until the consistency is a little\r\nthinner than cake frosting.\r\nSpread mint icing over brownies. Place brownies in the freezer for a short time to stiffen the icing. Remove from the freezer and carefully add a layer of chocolate icing. Yield: 9x13 pan of brownies.
1. For the meat, make sure the steak slices are dry by patting them with a paper towel. Slice them into strips, then add the cornstarch to the beef. Place the slices in a strainer and shake off excess corn starch. Begin to cook the rice while you prepare the rest of the meal.\r\n\r\n2. For the sauce, heat half of the oil in a large wok or pan at medium-high heat and add the garlic and the ginger. Immediately add the soy sauce, water, brown sugar and pepper flakes. Cook the sauce for about 2 minutes and transfer to a bowl. Don’t worry if the sauce doesn’t look thick enough at this point. The corn starch in the beef will thicken it up later.\r\n\r\n3. Place the meat in the same pan and cook, stirring until it is all browned (this is a quick thing). Pour the sauce back into the wok/pan and let it cook along with the meat.\r\n\r\n4. You can cook down the sauce to reduce it to thicken or leave it thinner. Add the green onions on the last minute so the green parts will stay green and the white parts crunchy. Serve it hot with rice. Serves 2.
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy. Stir in sugar, milk, egg, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes on a lightly floured surface, or until smooth. Place dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise. Let it rise 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in volume.\r\n\r\nPunch down dough, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball. Roll into balls, and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nDuring the second rising, preheat grill to high heat.\r\n\r\nAt grill side, roll one ball of dough out into a thin circle. Lightly oil grill. Place dough on grill, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffy and lightly browned. Brush uncooked side with butter, and turn over. Brush cooked side with butter, and cook until browned, another 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from grill, and continue the process until all the naan has been prepared.
Mix oats, coconut, and nuts in a bowl and set aside. Put milk, butter, sugar, and cocoa in a pot and stir constantly over medium heat until it reaches a rolling boil. Boil 1 minute and then add vanilla. Pour syrup over oatmeal, mix with spoon and drop onto waxed paper, then hide them from Jacie
Though you can find it year-round in some parts of the country, okra comes into its peak season from May through September. Choose pods that are small and crisp and avoid pods that have brown spots or blemishes or are shriveled. To store fresh okra, wrap it up and keep it in the fridge for up to 3 or 4 days. Okra can also be bought frozen, whole or sliced.\r\n\r\nHow you prep the okra will help determine how slimy it gets. Water enhances the sliminess so don’t wash the okra until you are ready to cook it. Let the okra sit at room temperature for a while before using it. The liquid that makes okra feel slimy comes out when you cut the okra so try to limit how much you cut the vegetable. Okra can be cooked whole; just cut or pull off the stems. If you are going to cook them whole, try to buy smaller pods.\r\n\r\nIf you do need to cut the okra, cut it into big chunks rather than thin slices. The more surface area, the more places slime has to escape. You can also poke holes in the top of the pod right beneath the stem and let some of the mucilage out. Then chop the okra the way you want it.\r\n\r\nIf you freeze okra and cut it while it is still frozen, it will less slimy than when you cut it fresh. A second trick for reducing sliminess is to soak the okra in vinegar for half an hour before cooking it. Rinse it and pat dry before cooking. Finally, you can pre-cook okra at very high heat by sautéing, roasting, blanching or grilling. Then add cooked okra to your recipe and there will be hardly any slime at all.\r\n\r\nHow you cook the okra is also important. As mentioned, cooking it at high heats helps eliminate a lot of slime. Make sure the okra is completely dry before cooking it. Get great tips on How to Cook Vegetables So They Don’t Wilt and How to Avoid Common Mistakes When Cooking Vegetables. Okra can be grilled on a grill pan or an outdoor grill. Just toss the pods in a bit of oil and your favorite seasonings, and then grill them for about 10 minutes until slightly charred. Fried okra is a popular dish that is crispy and delicious. Coat the okra with seasoned flour or cornmeal. They can be fried whole or in slices.\r\n\r\nSautéing is another good method of cooking. You need to saute it long enough for any slime to cook out, about 10-15 minutes. Don’t overcrowd the pan as that will lead to steaming which will create more slime. Dry roasting okra makes them taste nutty, grassy and slightly sweet. Small pods can be roasted whole while larger ones can be sliced in half lengthwise. Roast them at 400 degrees for about 25-30 minutes.
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\r\n   2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, vanilla and milk. In a separate larger bowl, stir together the rice flour, sugar, and baking powder. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir to blend. Mix in melted butter and coconut. Pour into the prepared pan.\r\n   3. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Cool completely, then cut into squares to serve.
Skin and chop the chicken into bite-sized pieces. You should be able to pull the skin off with reletive ease, and then cut around the bone. Saute the onion, garlic, beans, and shallot, and ginger in the dashi for about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nAdd the chicken. About mid-way through cooking the chicken mix the Soy Sauce, mirin, and sugar, and slowly add 1/2 of it to the chicken. BTW, if you want a more yellowy-oyakodon, use a light soy sauce instead and water down the stock a tad (otherwise it'd be too salty). I'm using standard dark soy here.\r\n\r\nOnce the chicken is cooked, check the flavor and add more of the soy sauce mixture if it needs it. If you prefer a more thicker sauce, add about a Tbsp of flour or 1/2 Tbsp of corn starch and let it simmer for 5 minutes while stiring it constantly.\r\n\r\nSlowly drizzle the beaten eggs on top of the chicken. Let it cook until the eggs start to harden. Flip the Oyakodon onto a bowl of hot rice - follow the recipe for sticky rice on the first page, however, don't cool it off and don't add the vinegar-sugar mixture to it. The heat of the rice should finish cooking the eggs. Garnish and serve.
Preheat oven to 475°. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12" cast-iron or heavy nonstick skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking. Nestle chicken in skillet, skin side down, and cook 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high; continue cooking skin side down, occasionally rearranging chicken thighs and rotating pan to evenly distribute heat, until fat renders and skin is golden brown, about 12 minutes.\r\n\r\n    Transfer skillet to oven and cook 13 more minutes. Flip chicken; continue cooking until skin crisps and meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate; let rest 5 minutes before serving.
Melt the butter in microwave for 30 seconds, set aside.\r\n\r\nIn a medium bowl, mix together flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.\r\nStir milk and egg together.\r\nCreate a well in the center of the flour mixture.\r\nPour the butter and milk mixture into the well.\r\nUse a wire whisk to stir everything together until just combined.\r\nIt will be slightly thick and lumpy, but should be well incorporated.\r\n\r\nAllow the batter to rest while heating a lightly oiled skillet or griddle to medium high heat.\r\nPour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.\r\nCook each side for 3-6 minutes, until lightly golden brown.
Sift and measure flour. Cream shortening, and add sugar, peanut butter, and egg. Beat well. Add dry ingredients. Bake on greased cookie sheet 350 degrees for 10 minutes
Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and place on a baking sheet in the freezer for at least 20 minutes, preferably 1 hour.\r\n\r\nCombine flour, kosher salt and sugar in a food processor (or a large bowl if mixing by hand). Pulse food processor a few times to mix. Slowly add the frozen butter, pulsing just as much as necessary to break the butter pieces into pea-size lumps. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing in between, until dough sticks to itself when pinched.\r\n\r\nRemove flour mixture from the food processor and place onto a clean, dry, flat surface. Gently shape into 2 disks. If the dough is too crumbly and refuses to cooperate, add more water, tablespoon by tablespoon, as needed.  I always need more water, just FYI.  The goal is to use as little water as possible to make it stay together. You will be able to see little specs of butter within the dough. These bits of butter, as they melt in the oven, will help make the crust flaky and delicious.\r\n\r\nSprinkle each disk lightly with flour and wrap individually in plastic wrap. Place in fridge for at least 20 minutes, preferably 1 hour.\r\n\r\nRemove one disk from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes to make it easier to roll out. Using a well-floured rolling pin on a lightly-floured surface, roll out dough to form an approximate 12-inch circle.  Be sure to continue to flip the dough over and lightly flour each side so as not to have the rolled-out dough stick to the surface.\r\n\r\nPlace the rolled-out dough onto a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the pie dough down so that it meets the bottom and sides of the pie dish. Using the back of a knife, trim the dough around the top edge of the pie dish, leaving about a 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch overlap.\r\n\r\nIf just filling your pie without pre-baking the bottom crust, do this now.  (If pre-baking, instructions follow).\r\n\r\nTo make the top to the pie, remove the second disk from the refrigerator.  Roll out the second disk of dough, just as before. Gently place the top crust over the pie dish. Pinch top and bottom of dough crusts firmly together.  Trim excess dough again with the back of a knife, leaving a 1/2-inch overlap. Fold the edge of the top piece of dough over and under the edge of the bottom piece of dough, pressing together. To seal the crust, you can either crimp the edges using your thumb and forefinger or press with a fork. Make 2-3 1-inch slits on the top of the pie with a sharp knife to allow for steam to escape during baking.\r\n\r\n*Depending on your recipe, you may need to pre-bake your crust prior to filling it.  If pre-baking, follow these instructions:\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees.\r\n\r\nButter and flour a 9-inch pie plate and then set aside.\r\n\r\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough. Place the dough in the pie plate and trim off excess and then crimp the edges. Use a fork to poke holes around the sides and bottom of the crust and chill until firm, about 20 min.\r\n\r\nCover the dough with a sheet of parchment paper and fill it with dried or baking beans. Bake until the crimped edges are firm, about 10-15 min. Remove the parchment paper and beans and bake until the bottom is firm, about another 10-15 min.\r\n\r\nFill the crust with the pie filling, spreading evenly.  Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake depending on your oven and the filling’s recipe.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!
Ladies and Gentlegoons, it's time to break out your drawstring pants. Pierogi when done well have been known to induce a condition commonly known as 'food coma'. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;\r\n\r\nTHE FILLING:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\r\n\r\nBoil your potatoes. I don't care how you do it. I recommend that you peel them however. Boil with a generous dash of salt and a clove or two of garlic. I add my garlic late due to personal taste but you can add yours at the start. It'll be one less thing to forget.\r\n\r\nSlice one onion and set it aside, forget about it till it's time to boil your pierogi. Chop one onion and put it in a pan to cook. When browned and soft, remove half the onion and reserve. \r\n\r\nWhile your onions are cooking check your potatoes. Hopefully you cut them small enough so that they are done soon. They won't be done now, but check anyway. You never know. If they are done, drain them and put them back in the hot pot. I have an electric range (oh god the suck) so I put the pot on a trivet on the counter. I add about a quarter cup sour cream and two tablespoons butter and let that sit and get nice and melty. while I finish with the meat part.\r\n\r\nTo the remaining onion add the ground beef and a couple cloves of chopped garlic. There isn't really a need for salt, but if you like black pepper, now is a good time. When the beef is just starting to lose the last of the pink, it's time to add flour. Grab yourself a little cup. I use a teacup I got at a Marukai that I broke and can no longer use for liquid anything. I think it's pretty and can't really bring myself to throw it away. So now it's my flour cup. Sprinkle flour into the meat a little at a time and stir it in. \r\n\r\nYou will continue doing this until the grease from the cheap beef is all worked into the flour. You're going to wanna cook it for a little bit, to cook the flour. This will make some flour stick to your pan. Do no fret. It's good. Leave it there. At this point, if you've not taken care of the potato part, take your pan with meat-goo off the heat and finish the potato part. \r\n\r\nSmash the potatoes. It doesn't matter if it's chunky or smooth. Whatever you like better. Add the meat-goo. Add the cooked onions you set aside earlier. Go back to your pan with all the cooked on flour gunk.\r\n\r\nAdd some butter. A tablespoon should do it. \r\n\r\nNow add some broth (or alcohol and broth. Whatever.) I usually use beef but I didn't have any handy. I did have home made chicken stock though. Add whatever it takes to get the goo off the bottom of your pan. Then reduce by half or so. \r\n\r\nAdd the goo-juice to your pot full of wonderful smelling goodness. \r\n\r\nNow mash it all together. It's going to look horrible. It's going to smell wonderful. If you were to be brave and taste a little, it would have a mouth feel that is kind of creamy (yay pan goo) and it would taste really super yummy. It looks like puke though.\r\n\r\n&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;THE DOUGH:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\r\n\r\nWhile the filling cools, it's time to make the dough. Mix your wet and your dry ingredients seperately. If you do not know the reason for this, go find the tuna sammich thread and come back when you've learned a little about dough. \r\n\r\nNow mix them together. \r\n\r\nYou will find that mixing by hand after a certain point is best. Yes, it's sticky. Yes, this is normal. Yes, it will wash off.\r\n\r\nPro Tip: Don't forget to take off any rings and/or watches/bracelets before mixing with your fingers. Also: Wash your hands you dirty morons\r\n\r\nKnead your dough. I would have pictures of this, however body parts got in the way and you couldn't see the dough. Simple method: Fold in half and press down, turn, repeat. Do this on a CLEAN floured surface, with clean floured hands. Add flour to the top of the dough and the surface as necessary. This is a very important step. This developes gluten in the dough. I cannot tell you how important this is. You MUST have gluten. However, if you knead it too much, you'll make it tough and that would suck. So yea, don't overdo it.\r\n\r\nNow you can put in a clean bowl (the same one works just fine if you've cleaned it.)\r\n\r\nNow would be a good time to roll out and cut your pierogi dough. I use a drinking glass because I'm ghetto like that. One batch of dough should get you around fifty pierogi, provided you roll out your scraps. The filling you made should be more than enough. After you've cut the circles, you might want to cut up your cabbage (if you've having that on the side). Put your cabbage into a strainer of some sort, and salt it liberally. Toss for even distribution and set aside (over a bowl) to drain. \r\n\r\n&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;THE DRESSING:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\r\n\r\nSour cream goes in a container that is good for storing as well as mixing. I use two really big heaping spoonfulls, which is about a quarter cup. (I have insanely large spoons that are no good for eating with.) To the sour cream you want to add white vinegar a little at a time and mix it in. You'll want just enough to get a heavy cream consistancy. Remember, if you didn't add enough, you can always put in more, but if you add too much, you can't take it out. Taste it when it's done. If it needs salt, add a tiny bit. (Note: if you're putting garlic in the dressing, don't use any salt right now.) \r\n\r\nNow you slice up the garlic, then you smash it. I use the flat of my blade and press down and pull across the garlic. It helps to sprinkle a little salt on the garlic before doing this. JUST A LITTLE THOUGH.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have your own dill plant, you'll have to buy the fresh stuff on the root ball from the market. Fresh dill is the only way to go here. Dried stuff just isn't the same. Dill is not optional for this dressing. I used a healthy dose (probably two tablespoons or so) and added the dill along with my two cloves killed garlic to the sourcream/vinegar base. Grind some black pepper into it, stir it up and you're done. Pop a lid on it and put it in the fridge till dinner time. \r\n\r\n&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;STUFFING AND COOKING&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\r\n\r\nBy now, with all that work, your filling should be cool. You are so ready to start stuffing. First you take a cut out, stretch it a little bit in the middle, drop some filling in the depression, and then pinch the little bugger shut like a pot sticker. Now that was easy. Repeat at least six times per person you are feeding. We made 25, eight for each of us (food coma, I'm telling you.) and one for the cats to split since they are such beggers. \r\n\r\nBoil your pierogies. Plenty of water, only a few at a time. You should put your onions on a back burner right about now too. I fry them with lard. They get crispy and delicious that way. You should also put a heavy pan on a low to medium heat and start heating your frying medium. That is if you're going to use enough that waiting for it to heat up is an issue. I use lard (oh so crispy!) I fry mine in about two inches of oil too.\r\n\r\nLard is good!\r\n\r\nAs you take a batch out, place it somewhere it can drain. I use a collander. When they are all done, it's smart to take your boiling pot, rinse it out, dry it, place some papertowels in the bottom and put it on top of your range. The heat from the oven keeping your cabbage warm will also keep the pot warm, which is a good thing.\r\n\r\nFry your pierogi in small batches, because it's better that way. You'll have to turn them over, no matter how deep your oil is, so just enough in the pan to float them is best. If they don't float, parts will touch the bottom of the pan and you'll have two choices. You can serve pierogi with done spots on part and mostly not done all over, or you can serve pierogi done all over except for those burned spots where they were resting on your pan. Floating is best. You want them out just before golden because they will continue to cook after you take them out of the oil. \r\n\r\n&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Alternative cabbage side dish:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\r\n\r\nIf you are working alone, set the stuffed pierogi aside and work on your cabbage. Rinse it well, and set it to drain again while you cut all the white fat off the bacon leaving only the red and pink meaty bits. Chop those bits up tiny. Put it all in a pan that you intend on cooking your cabbage in. I warn you, if you buy quality bacon, it will not give off as much fat as the cheap stuff. You'll probably have to add some fat to the pan in order to coat your cabbage. (I recommend lard, following the whole pork fat theme of the bacon but vegitable oil works too.) After the white stuff is all spent and grosser looking than before, get rid of it. If you have a dog, it might be ok to feed that to the dog. I'm not sure though. I don't suggest you feed it to cats. If you have to add fat to your pan, do it now and let it heat up. Add the cabbage and stir to coat. Sautee for a couple minutes (until the green parts of your cabbage turn BRIGHT green.) turn your oven on to warm (or the lowest setting you have,) and toss the pan in there. If the pan is not oven safe, put your cabbage in an oven safe serving type dish and put that in the oven.
Mix yeast, honey, 2/3 cup of flour, and 3/4 cup of water.\r\n\r\nLet this mixture rest 5 for minutes.\r\n\r\nNow add Sea Salt and Olive Oil and mix it up!\r\n\r\nBlend in rest of flour about a half a cup at a time in, it will eventually turn in to a Dough Ball.\r\n\r\nSmash it on to a well-floured surface and knead it out until it is smooth and elastic.\r\n\r\nRoll the dough into a ball, then place a kitchen towel over the dough and let it rest for approximately 10-15 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen the time is up cut the dough into two pieces forming each in to a ball, coat these both with extra virgin olive oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW! Pick ONE of three options:\r\n\r\n1. Place a kitchen towel over the dough and let sit for ONE HOUR, after this roll out dough and add your favorite toppings and CREATE pizza.\r\n\r\n2. Place both in separate plastic resealable bags and place in refrigerator for TWO DAYS, after this remove from fridge and let sit for 30 minutes, then roll out dough and add your favorite toppings and CREATE pizza.\r\n\r\n3. Place both in separate plastic resealable bags and place in refrigerator for ONE MONTH, after this remove from freezer and let sit for 1 hour, then roll out dough and add your favorite toppings and CREATE pizza.
Combine everything in order. Try not to get too much mayo in it (amount is more of a preference thing). Great on salads or in sandwiches.
Pour hashbrowns in pot and cover with water. Cook until soft. Add all other ingredients except cheese. Bring to boil, add cheese, and stir until melted
Preheat oven to 400-degrees. Place a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet.\r\n\r\nSlice the Ciabatta loaf in half, lengthwise. Brush olive oil onto the inside of the top and bottom slices of Ciabatta.\r\n\r\nLayer the following ingredients in this order: mozzarella slices, tomatoes, and basil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little bit of balsamic vinegar. Top with the other half of bread, and place the sandwich on the baking sheet.\r\n\r\nPlace something heavy and oven-proof on top of the sandwich. You can use a brick wrapped in foil, or a heavy baking dish.... get creative. Place the heavy object on top of the sandwich, and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the heavy object from the top of the sandwich, and brush the top of the sandwich with olive oil (you could also use olive oil spray, which is what I did). Bake an additional 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted.\r\n\r\nRemove from oven and let cool for about 5 minutes. Use a serrated knife to slice into 4 equal slices.
In a medium bowl beat the softened cream cheese with a hand mixer (or a standing mixer), until creamy.  Add the mashed pumpkin, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, vanilla, and beat until well incorporated.\r\n\r\nBring the caramel to room temp and mix into pumpkin mixture, stirring until no caramel chunks remain.\r\n\r\nBeat the half &amp;amp; half and eggs together, until well combined.  Slowly add the egg mixture to the caramel pumpkin mixture, and stir until well incorporated.\r\n\r\nPour into the prepared pie crust and bake for 45-55 minutes, or until just set (toothpick inserted in the middle comes out slightly clean)\r\n\r\nLet cool completely before serving.
Cake Ingredients\r\n12 large egg whites, room temperature\r\n2 cups whole milk, room temperature\r\n4 1/2 tsp vanilla extract\r\n4 1/2 cups sifted cake flour\r\n3 1/2 cups white granulated sugar\r\n2 tbsp + 2 tsp baking powder\r\n1 1/2 tsp salt\r\n36 tbsp (6 ounces) unsalted butter, room temperature, cubed\r\n2 boxes of food coloring (red, yellow, green, blue)\r\n\r\nIcing Ingredients\r\n4 cups sifted powdered sugar\r\n10 tbsp butter, room temperature\r\n4 tbsp milk\r\n1 tsp vanilla\r\n\r\nDirections\r\n1. Preheat oven to 350 F.\r\n\r\n2. In a bowl, combine the egg whites, 1/2 cup milk, and vanilla extract. Set to the side.\r\n\r\n3. In a separate (large) bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt, with a hand mixer on low speed until ingredients are combined.\r\n\r\n4. Add the butter and the remaining 1 1/2 cups of milk to the flour mixture. Mix on low speed until all ingredients are moistened. Increase the speed to medium and mix for 1 1/2 minutes. The batter should appear thick.\r\n\r\n5. Add the milk/egg mixture in 3 separate batches, mixing until combined, approximately 20 seconds each batch.\r\n\r\n6. Separate the cake batter into 6 bowls. Add enough food coloring {approximately 50 drops} to make one red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple cake. To make orange, use red and yellow food coloring. To make purple, use red and blue.\r\n\r\n7. Next, spray the cake pans with cooking oil and then line with parchment paper. {I used 2, 9" cake pans, and then cut the cake into 6" circles once cooked}. Pour the red batter into one pan, and the orange batter into the other. Bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove the pans from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Remove the cake from the pans, and let cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Continue the process until all 6 cakes are done. Once the cakes have cooled, wrap them in Saran wrap and place in the freezer for one hour. They will be much easier to handle when icing.\r\n\r\n8. To make the icing, mix with a hand blender, the icing sugar and butter until smooth. Add the vanilla to the milk, and then slowly drizzle into the sugar and butter mixture. Beat at high speed for at least 5 minutes. The longer you mix, the fluffier the icing.\r\n\r\n9. With a piece of cardboard, trace a 6"circle (or any desired shape). Remove cake from the freezer and using the cardboard as a stencil, cut out the same size circles. Place the purple cake on top of the cardboard and top with icing. Follow with the blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, icing in between each cake layer. Cover the top and the sides with icing, and decorate as desired.
In a medium bowl, add soy sauce, mirin and water. Mix to combine. Pour liquid into a plastic bag or container that you will be using to marinate the eggs. You want to use something which allows the eggs to be completely submerged in the marinade. I put my eggs in a container that just barely fit all the eggs and marinade. I then placed a lid on top to keep the eggs from floating above the marinade.\r\n    Marinate eggs for about 4 hours or overnight in the fridge. I recommend overnight for the best flavor. Eggs can be eaten cold or you can add them to hot ramen broth to warm them up.
Preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly grease a 6"x9" baking dish and set aside.\r\n    In a medium mixing bowl, combine the crushed tomatoes, oil and vinegar. Stir in the garlic, basil, herbs de Provence, salt, pepper, and chili powder.\r\n    Pour the tomato mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth it into an even layer on the bottom of the pan.\r\n    Stack the veggie slices in alternating patters (e.g.: onion, zucchini, eggplant, tomato; repeat) and place them on their side in the pan, leaning against the edge of the pan. Repeat until you've formed a couple of rows of veggies, filled the pan, and used up all of the veggie slices.\r\n    Optionally, spray or brush the exposed tops of the veggies with oil to encourage browning in the oven. This is more for appearance, so feel free to skip this step if you want.\r\n    Bake for about an hour, until the tomato sauce at the bottom is bubbling and the veggies are tender.\r\n    Garnish with additional chopped fresh basil before serving (optional). Serve hot or cold.
Mix up the worcestershire, soy, garlic and mustard, then spread it on the bread. THEN slice up some sharp cheddar and toss it onto the bread. Put it into an oven or some other heating vessel of crispyness, toast it until the cheese is bubbly and a little browned, then take it out and let it cool for a minute or two. For extra tang, put a slice of tomato on top of it.
Cook the ground beef in a skillet until it's mostly done. Don't worry if there's a some pink meat left, since it'll get cooked all the way through later with the other stuff. Make sure you crumble it up into small bits while it's cooking. Salt and pepper it up as you like. Make sure you drain the excess grease though, otherwise it'll make the leftovers less appetizing later on.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, get a medium-to-large sized pot, for behold, you shall then put into it the beef stock, spinach, cooked ground beef, and tomatoes in. Now's also a good time to throw in a little more salt, pepper, and whatever other experimental flavorings you want. Put it on, say, medium heat and cover it. You'll want it at a slow, gentle bubble, since you don't really need to cook anything so much as heat it up so the flavors kind of fuse together. Do this for maybe 35-45 minutes (and keep it covered!!!! OR YOU"LL DIE!!!!!), stirring occasionally, then put in the chopped garlic. Cover it again and continue heating it for 10 minutes, stirring now and then. If the garlic and tomato turns out too weak-tasting this time around, just add them later into the cooking next time. I usually add the garlic in the last three minutes or so, otherwise I end up losing some of the spiciness. But if you've got a nanny tongue then you should put the garlic in earlier.\r\n\r\nYou can eat it as-is like a plain stoup, though I like having it in a bowl on top of a bed of white jasmine rice. Have a side of warm pita too, since it's just delicious to dip into this stuff.\r\n\r\nAlso, this recipe will easily serve four or five, so prepare for leftovers.
Poke some holes in the yam like you would a regular potato. If you don't want to wait around forever for it to cook, what I do is I put it in the microwave for two 3-5 minute cookings (after the first round I flip it over, then do the same time on the other side. For a small yam go with like 3-4 minutes, 5 for big ones). Then I'll put it in the oven/toaster oven for about 40 minutes on 350 degrees. This speeds up the cooking process a bit while still getting you a really nice crisp skin like you would if you baked it in the oven all the way through.\r\n\r\nYou'll want to put it on top of some foil or a baking sheet underneath it though, since yams tend to bubble syrup out of the holes you poke in them when they're cooking.\r\n\r\nCrumble up the bacon just as the yam's almost done, and put about half a tablespoon of butter in the bowl you're going to eat it in, sprinkle a little salt down there too. Take the yam out, put it in the bowl, cut it open and put the rest of the butter, bacon, cheese and a quick squirt of Sriracha in there. This stuff is spicy for any of you sensitive to hot stuff, so go easy on it at first. Just add more later if you need it.\r\n\r\nMix up the insides a bit, and you're all set. Salt it to taste as you eat.\r\n\r\nWhat I like to do is eat the insides first, then by the time I'm done, the butter that was in the bottom of the bowl is all melted over the yam's skin, which makes it especially tasty to finish up on.\r\n\r\nThere's a little bit of fat involved in this due to the butter and bacon, but if you go easy on it it's a pretty healthy dish. Yams are incredibly good for you, and I find that eating one for dinner gives me a little bit of fresh energy the next day for a workout
1) Cook the bacon, then cut it up into pretty small pieces, as if you were to put it on a sissy salad.\r\n2) Spice up the ground beef and put in a little bit of Tabasco and soy sauce just to give it some zing. Knead around the meat. With your BARE HANDS. Do not sanitize beforehand.\r\n3) Make a patty. Put the blue cheese and bacon in the middle of the patty, then make another patty and smash it on top of that one. Now you've got yourself a huge-**** patty with blue cheese and bacon stuffed inside it.\r\n4) Get a woman to cook it.\r\n5) Go watch something manly like wrestling, Nascar or Oprah while the woman cooks. Cuss loudly until it's done.\r\n6) Eat it, with no buns. &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;****.&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;\r\n7) When it gets to the really good part, chuck your **** plate at the wall and punch your fist through the **** cat. &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;****!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;
Melt margarine in a large saucepan over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Cook over low heat 3 min longer, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add rice krispies cereal, stir well until coated. Use buttered spatula or waxed paper to press into a 13x9 pan and let cool
1. Discard any excess liquid that the Ricotta’s packaging may contain, then add Ricotta cheese, egg yolk, salt and freshly grated Parmigiano into a large bowl. Mix well with a wooden or regular spoon. Now add the flour and stir in briefly, just until combined* – the dough will still be quite sticky. (Of course you can add more flour at this point, but keep in mind, that the more flour you use, the denser the gnocchi become in the end. And you want them to be as light &amp;amp; fluffy as possible, with a velvet-like texture.)\r\n* Note: Remember, you're not making bread, so don't knead. As long as the mixture comes together, you're done. Overwork the dough, and the gnocchi will turn out tough. Add too much flour, and you will feel like you've just had bricks for lunch.\r\n\r\n2. Forming these gnocchi is the slightly tricky step, this is the technique that works best for me: Generously flour a board, take a big tablespoon of the dough and scoop it onto the board. It gets dusted with flour (dust your hands generously, too!), before rolling it into a finger-thick roll. Cut it into little pillows (stick the knife’s blade into the flour to prevent it from sticking to the dough). Then place each gnoccho on a floured board or parchment paper lined baking tray. Continue quickly with the next step, otherwise they will get soggy and stick to the paper/board anyway.\r\n* Note: For me, I used 50g flour, with 1 or 2 tbsps for dusting. Yes, very little flour, so the gnocchi was a tad sticky when I was shaping them, which was a teensy challenge because you need a very light hand when doing that. BUT they turned out really tender and airy. So I say, err on the side of stickiness. You're gonna wash your hands later, anyway. :)\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to a boil, add a generous pinch of salt and reduce heat until the water bubbles lightly. Add the gnocchi and stir once, so they don’t stick to the bottom – then let cook until they start floating on top. Depending on their size this may take 2 to 4 minutes. Take out with a skimmer and serve immediately. Serve them either with a simple tomato sauce, browned butter with fresh sage or any kind of pesto.\r\n\r\n4. I made a simple sage and brown butter sauce. Just gently heat about 50g of unsalted butter with chiffonade of sage. Cook till the butter has browned but not burnt - and note that all it takes is a couple of seconds to cross over from one to the other - and the sage has become crispy. The butter should have a lovely nutty aroma and flavour, with nuances of earthiness from the sage.\r\n\r\nI made indentations using the tines of a fork, but really, I would skip this the next time.\r\n\r\n6. I did the extra step of browning my gnocchi so that they would be crisp on the outside. All you need to do is, after removing them from the salted water with a slotted spoon, place them in a non-stick pan (no oil needed) and let them brown nicely on both sides. Don't move them around too much. Once done, arrange them on a plate and drizzle your accompanying sauce over.\r\n\r\nBuon appetito!
1. First, let your chicken come to room temperature before you roast it. \r\n\r\nTake your chicken out of the fridge at least 45 minutes before you start roasting it. If it's still refrigerator-cold when you put it in the oven, your cooking time will be longer, and your chicken won't be as tender.\r\n\r\n2. Don't wash your chicken\r\n\r\nRinsing your chicken just spreads gross raw chicken germs all over your sink. If you cook the meat to the proper temperature (165 degrees), any dangerous germs or bacteria will be killed anyway. \r\n\r\n 3. Preheat the oven to 450°F. \r\n \r\n  4. Dry your chicken REALLY WELL on the outside, AND on the inside\r\n  \r\n  Any excess moisture will create steam and actually make your chicken drier. So use paper towels to pat your chicken dry on the outside. Then, grab a few more paper towels and stick them inside the cavity; it'll feel weird, and you're going to pull out some gross gunk, but this step is absolutely essential to the awesomeness of your resulting chicken.\r\n  \r\n 5. Next, sprinkle kosher salt and pepper inside the chicken cavity. \r\n \r\nThe salt that you sprinkle in the cavity will get absorbed into the meat from the inside, meaning that all of the meat will be flavorful, not just the outside surface.\r\n\r\n 6. Then you're gonna truss your chicken, and it's going to be so easy. Here's how: \r\n\r\nCut a piece of butcher's twine that's about 24 inches long and lay your chicken on a cutting board, breast side up with the legs facing away from you.\r\n\r\nPut the center of the twine under the tail.\r\n\r\nCross the ends then loopback under around the legs and pull the string tight to bring the legs together.\r\n\r\nFlip your chicken over. Bring the twine around the sides, tucking in the wings.\r\n\r\nPull the twine tight and tie a knot at the neck, but loop the string through the knot twice (this is called a butcher's knot). Then tighten. Cut extra twine with scissors or your knife\r\n\r\n 7. Season the outside of your chicken with lots of salt and some pepper. \r\n \r\n A 4-pound chicken will need about a tablespoon. Don't just pour salt out of a container; use your hand to sprinkle salt all over the chicken to ensure that it's evenly coated.\r\n \r\n 8. Place the chicken breast side up on a rack over a roasting pan. \r\n \r\n One surprising lesson from BuzzFeed's Ultimate Roast Chicken Tournament is that the recipes that called for a roasting rack were the most successful. Using a rack is worth it, and ensures that your chicken cooks evenly and doesn't stick to the pan.\r\n \r\n  9. Put it in the 450°F oven for 50–60 minutes. \r\n  \r\n  Four hundred and fifty degrees is hot! Roasting your chicken at super high heat crisps the skin and cooks the meat as quickly as possible so that it doesn't get dry.\r\n  \r\n   10. No flipping, no basting, no checking on the chicken unless smoke starts pouring out. \r\n   \r\n First of all, opening your oven while the chicken is cooking will decrease the oven heat and increase cooking time. Flipping your bird is unnecessary when you're roasting on a rack, since the heat is hitting all sides of the bird evenly. And basting? It can actually make the skin of your chicken soggy, since you're likely basting with not only fat but also liquid\r\n \r\n 11. Your chicken is done when its internal temperature is 165 degrees. \r\n \r\n Insert your thermometer right between the breast and the thigh; this is the thickest part of the chicken. If you cook the chicken past 165 degrees, it will start to dry out and won't be as flavorful as it could be.\r\n \r\n  12. Let your chicken sit on a cutting board for 15 minutes before removing the twine and carving. \r\n  \r\n When your chicken is cooked, take it off the rack and set it on the cutting board, then wait 15 minutes before you do anything else. Letting the chicken "rest" gives the juices a chance to settle, so that they soak into your meat and flavor it, instead of just flowing out onto the cutting board.
Put turkey in an oven bag breast side down.\r\n\r\nCook at 325 degrees for 2.5 - 3 hours depending on size (use the bag instructions as a guideline)\r\n\r\nPull it when armpit temperature is 161\r\n\r\nCover with foil for a half hour and it will continue to cook another few degrees. 165 is the number you really want
Take a quarter of your white onion, and chop it up really good. Take your delicious ground-up cow and toss it into a bowl. Don't worry about breaking it up just yet. Throw your onions on top, along with healthy doses of sea salt and black pepper, and about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire Sauce.\r\n\r\nIf you've touched anything questionable recently, now's the time to wash your hands because you're about to get them dirty again. Just like with the meatloaf, mix it all up using your hands.\r\n\r\nWhile you have a pan containing about 3 tablespoons of olive oil and one clove of chopped garlic heating up, make one-inch thick oval patties out of your meat.\r\n\r\nWhen your pan is hot, toss in your meat. Cook that sucker for about 6 minutes per side. While your meat is cooking, rinse out your bowl you used earlier and toss your mushrooms in. Sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper.\r\n\r\nAfter your steak is done, keep it warm and put it aside. Take your pan you just used, and toss in another tablespoon of olive oil and a bit of butter. Heat it, and throw in your mushrooms. Sautée until tender.\r\n\r\nWhen your mushrooms are ready, pour in a can of beef broth. Simmer that mixture for a few minutes (scraping the bits up from the bottom of the pan), then add about two tablespoons of flour. Mix it up, and let it thicken for one to two minutes.\r\n\r\nGet your steak, toss it on a plate and spoon some sauce over top. Serve with a baked potato or some BS like that. Feel free to put the gravy on your potato if you're into that sort of thing; I couldn’t care less. Enjoy your home-cooked meal.
Coat the wings in the sake and sesame oil and set aside.\r\n    Set up 2 plates both covered with a few layers of paper towel.\r\n\r\n    Prepare the coating by combining the flour,  salt and pepper.\r\n    Heat the vegetable oil in a wok over high heat until dropping some crumbs in sizzle straight away. Drop the heat to med-high.\r\n    Coat 4 wing pieces in the coating then carefully place in the hot oil (don't drop them). Let them sizzle away, turning now and then for about 4 minutes, then transfer to one of the paper towel covered plates. Repeat with remaining wings.\r\n    Top up the oil a little and deep fry the wings a second time until golden and crisp (another 4 minutes). Transfer to the second plate with paper towel. Repeat with remaining wings.\r\n    Tip the hot oil away into a heat proof pan or dish and wipe the wok out with paper towel.\r\n    Heat the peanut oil in the wok until very hot and add the chilli, onions, ginger and garlic, plus another small pinch of both salt and pepper. Stir fry for a couple of minutes until very aromatic.\r\n    Add the wings to the wok and toss to coat in the aromats, then tip out onto a serving plate.\r\n    Serve with kewpie mayonnaise.
Heat a frying pan over medium low heat.\r\n\r\nPlace all ingredients in a blender. Start on low then turn up to high speed.\r\n\r\nBlend for 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nPour into preheated pan. Stir with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom as you go, until all the eggs are cooked. If you like browned bottom eggs, fry a little longer.
Heat oil in large skillet. Add onion and garlic and cook 2 minutes. Add chicken, carrots, potatoes and stir. Cook a few minutes then add curry paste and powder, then stir into the meat mixture to blend. Add coconut milk and fish sauce, blend well. Bring to a boil and let simmer until potatoes begin to soften, about 15 mins. Add remaining veggies, when mixture is completely heated through, add cream and bring to a boil. When mixture begins to boil, remove from heat and serve over rice.
I read a lot of recipes that called for marinating the roast overnight in things like root beer, coke, ginger ale, or all sorts of rubs, but that seemed kind of weird to me and in the end I forgot to do it, so my roast went into the crock pot naked as the day it was carved off the pig. I filled the crock pot about halfway with water (mine is quite a large slow cooker) so that it almost covered the meat. I did add a few shakes of onion flakes and some Lawry's Seasoning Salt. I set it on Low and went to work.\r\n\r\nRoughly 7 1/2 hours later I got home and pulled the roast out with my giant roasting fork, dumped out the water, and used tongs to shred the meat back into the crock pot while holding with the fork. This made it easy to avoid all the fat/connective tissues and big veins that were left. Once it was all shredded in and the dog thought she'd died and gone to heaven from the tiny chunk of fatty meat I allowed her, I added an entire bottle of the BBQ sauce and stirred it all up. I let it simmer on Low for about another hour and a half to really get the BBQ sauce flavor into the meat. Before serving, I poured some more BBQ sauce in there because we like saucier sandwiches.\r\n\r\nWhen ready to serve, we scooped a generous amount onto a toasted sesame seed bun and voila! Delicious and really pretty inexpensive BBQ pulled pork! This made about 8 sandwiches, but for normal people might make ten, haha :D
In 3 1/2- to 4 1/2-quart slow cooker, mix beef, onion, soups, mushrooms and pepper.\r\n\r\nCover and cook on low heat setting 8 to 10 hours or until beef is very tender.\r\n\r\nStir cream cheese into beef mixture until melted. Stir sour cream into beef mixture. Serve over noodles.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.\r\n\r\nCream butter and sugar thoroughly. Add flour, salt, vanilla and pecans, and mix well. Cover dough and chill for half an hour.\r\n\r\nForm dough into small balls* (about 1-inch diameter), and place 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake until set, but do not brown (8-10 minutes). Allow to cool for 3 minutes before removing from baking sheet, then roll in the additional powdered sugar. When completely cool, roll again in powdered sugar.\r\n\r\n*Remember my cousin Dawn's advice here. If the dough seems too powdery, never, ever add water. Just work the dough in your hands until it comes together.
IN a glass bowl beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Continue beating while you prepare the syrup.\r\n\r\nIn a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, water, and cream of tartar and bring to a boil with lid on (so steam will melt crystals on the sides of the pan)\r\n\r\nRemove lid and continue boiling to the soft-ball stage (240 F). Pour hot syrup in a fine stream into egg whites, beating as you pour. Beat for about 5 more minutes.\r\n\r\nSpread te icing quickly on the roof and grounds of the gingerbread house, pulling it down into icicles on the eaves (don't try and go back to make icicles afterwards)
Step 1 - Season, Vacuum, Submerge\r\n\r\nGenerously season your steaks with salt, pepper, garlic, etc - you know how to do this. I personally am a big fan of Montreal Steak Seasoning, but whatever you like works great. Put your steaks into ziploc bags and vacuum all the air out. If you have a legit vacuum pack, great. If not, do what I did - submerge slowly so the water pressure forces all the air out, then seal it. Then fully submerge in a cooler (or crock pot) with the hottest tap water you can get.\r\n\r\nStep 2 - Raise to cooking temperature.\r\n\r\nYou'll need a meat thermometer for this ($10). To cook 1” thick steaks to medium, raise the water temp to 140 deg F (60C). I boiled a pot with a bunch of hot water and slowly added to the cooler while stirring and checking the temp regularly to get to 140. Use this chart for to find the right temperature based on meat type, thickness and doneness: http://www.sousvidesupreme.com/en-us/learn/sousvide_cookingtemperatures.htm\r\n\r\nStep 3 - Go do something else.\r\n\r\nMaybe the best part of cooking sous vide - It's so easy. Walk away. The meat can sit and cook for anywhere from 1-4 hours. Go prep your veggies, watch a movie, etc. After 4 hours, the meat becomes almost too tender. Less than 1, and bacteria's not dead yet. Relax and let it sit my friend. My cooler lost about 1 degree per hour. but YMMV. A physics guy could answer differently, but I think that the hotter you're trying to cook at, the more quickly you'll lose temp. In other words, the cooler method probably works great at 140 degrees, but you'll likely need a legit sous vide machine to cook at 180.\r\n\r\nStep 4 - Sear it and finish it.\r\n\r\nEverything I've read recommends using a super hot skillet with oil, butter, aromatics etc to sear it and finish it. I had the grill ready from doing the kids burgers. Whatever method you choose, use HIGH heat and only sear it for a minute or two on each side. The meat's cooked already, you're just trying to get that charry caramelized flavor.
Peel, quarter lengthwise, &amp;amp; cut potatoes into ¼” slices. Cook on low in olive oil in a covered skillet, stirring every few minutes, until tender. Add the onion about halfway through this process. The potatoes should crumble easily with a fork. Take off heat, mix with eggs &amp;amp; salt in a medium sized bowl. Make sure to mash it well. Coat skillet with oil again, or non-stick spray or something. Heat on high. Pour mixture into hot skillet, spreading evenly, and immediately turn heat down to low. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, jiggling the pan from side to side to sear it. Cover skillet with plate, flip upside down to get it on the plate, then carefully slide the tortilla batter-side down to cook the other side for about 5 min. Let cool &amp;amp; eat.
Peel, quarter, and cut potatoes into 1/4 slices. Cook on low in a covered skillet with oil, stirring occasionally until tender. Add the onion about halfway through. Take off heat, mix with eggs and salt in a medium sized bowl. Make sure to mash it well. Coat skillet with oil again and set to high heat. Pour mixture into skillet, spreading evenly. Pan cook on low for about 5 minutes, jiggling from side to side to sear it. After 5 minutes, flip it over (I recommend using a plate to assist you). Cook the other side for about 5 minutes.
Cook veggies in wok over medium heat until warmed through; set aside. Cut steak into thin strips and fry until done. Then prepare the sauce ingredients.\r\n\r\nStir until cornstarch is dissolved. Pour this into the meat, cooking until it turns from cloudy to clear/ no longer looks milky/ starts to thicken. Add veggies back in, stir, make sure everything’s nice and hot. Ready to serve.
Preheat oven to 350.\r\n\r\nFor crust, prepare cookie mix according to package. Spread evenly onto ungreased 12 inch pizza pan or cookie sheet. Bake at 350 for 14-16 minutes or until edges are light brown. Cool completely.\r\n\r\nFor filling, combine cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract in small bowl. Beat at low speed with electric mixer until smooth. Spread on cooled crust. Refrigerate until chilled.\r\n\r\nFor topping, dry fruits thoroughly on paper towels. Arrange fruit in circles on chilled crust working from outside edge towards center. Brush fruit with warmed preserves to glaze. Refrigerate until ready to serve
In a mixing bowl add all the ingridents mentioned under sauce. Mix well and keep aside.\r\n    Using a kitchen towel, pat dry chicken wings. Put them in a bog mix bowl. Season lightly with salt and pepper.\r\n    In a small mixing bowl mix cornstarch and baking powder\r\n    Add cornstarch mixture in 2-3 batches to the chicken wings. Toss well before adding another batch of cornstarch mixture.\r\n    Heat a heavy bottom pan or cast iron skillet. Add vegetable oil\r\n    Spread the chicken wings in a single layer. Cook undisturbed on medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Turn the wings and cook further 4-5 minutes. The wings should feel crispy and look light golden brown in color.\r\n    Remove the wings and put on a wired rack while you make the sauce.\r\n    Add above sauce mixture to the same pan. Cook sauce until it is half in quantity and looks little thick.\r\n    Add chicken wings and toss well until wings are well coated with the sauce. During this sauce will thicken even further, So maintain low heat.
Combine filling material in baking dish. Mix the topping in a separate bowl, then put on top of filling just before baking.\r\n\r\nBake 20 minutes covered and then 15-20 minutes uncovered at 350
Begin by adding the potatoes into a sauce pan with 1 cup of Kosher salt. It may seem excessive, but the salt isn't able to penetrate into the potato, thus being perfectly seasoned.\r\n\r\nAdd the 5 cups of water to your pan and place on medium high heat\r\n\r\nOnce the water reaches a boil, let simmer for 15-20 minutes.\r\n\r\nAs they cook, you will begin to see the salt crust over parts exposed to the air. Additionally, by the time this dish is done, your stove top and pan will have a light crusting of salt.\r\n\r\nAt this point, serve and eat warm with a side of melted butter.
Soak corn husks for a few hours beforehand. I am assuming you will also do some kind of slow cooked pulled pork / shredded chicken, so start that in advance as well.\r\n\r\nFor masa dough, combine cornmeal and spices until evenly mixed. Add lard (can substitute combinations of shortening, bacon grease or corn oil) and mix in an electric mixer until dough forms. Add the chicken broth, a little at a time, until the dough is light, moist, but not sticky. The test is to seee if a dollop of dough will float in water, then you know it's done.\r\n\r\nSpread out corn husks. In the corner of each, spread a 1/4 inch thick rectangle of dough, and add your filling to the middle. Leave about 1/2 inch free on each edge. Roll the husk and place upright into a steamer pot. Repeat twenty times.\r\n\r\nSteam tamales for 2 hours (covered or uncovered? we started our covered and then opened it halfway through so they wouldn't get soggy...)
PREHEAT oven to 375° F.\r\n\r\nCOMBINE flour, baking soda and salt in small bowl. Beat butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla extract in large mixer bowl until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually beat in flour mixture. Stir in morsels and nuts. Drop by rounded tablespoon onto ungreased baking sheets.\r\n\r\nBAKE for 9 to 11 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.\r\n\r\nPAN COOKIE VARIATION: Grease 15 x 10-inch jelly-roll pan. Prepare dough as above. Spread into prepared pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pan on wire rack. Makes 4 dozen bars.\r\n\r\nSLICE AND BAKE COOKIE VARIATION:\r\nPREPARE dough as above. Divide in half; wrap in waxed paper. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until firm. Shape each half into 15-inch log; wrap in wax paper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.* Preheat oven to 375° F. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices; place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely. Makes about 5 dozen cookies.
1. Bring a large stockpot with water to boil over high heat. When it comes to a rolling boil, add the beef bones and boil vigourously for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. In the meantime, heat a frying pan on medium-low heat. Add the Vietnamese Pho Spices and toast until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Dump the spices to the empty Crock Pot or slow cooker immediately. Return frying pan to medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil is hot, add the ginger slices and the onion half. Cook until the ginger is browned on both sides and the onion half is nicely browned and softened. Add the ginger and the onion to the Crock Pot or slow cooker.\r\n\r\n3. When the bones have been pre-boiled, drain, discard water and rinse bones briefly to clean them. Add the bones to the Crock Pot or slow cooker. Fill the Crock Pot with fresh, clean, cool water to just 1-1/2 inches below surface, add the fish sauce and sugar. Cover and set the Crock Pot or slow cooker to cook on low for 8 hours. Taste and season with additional fish sauce if needed.\r\n\r\n4. When you are just about ready to eat, you’ll prep the rest of the ingredients for the Pho bowls. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the beef balls and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove the balls, keeping the water boiling and now cook the noodles according to package instructions. If you are using fresh noodles, all they need is a couple of minutes. Drain immediately.\r\n\r\n5. Strain the stock with a fine meshed sieve. Discard the solids.\r\n\r\n6. Line up 4 large bowls on counter. Distribute the noodles, beef balls and thin steak slices evenly amongst the bowls. Ladle the hot Pho stock into each bowl. The hot stock should cook the thin steak slices. Serve with lime wedges, fresh herbs, chili peppers, Hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot chili sauce at the table.
Preheat oven to 400°. In saucepan, heat all but yeast and flour. Set pan aside to cool to about 105°. Pour into mixing bowl, then add yeast to liquid mixture, stir to dissolve. Add five cups of flour and mix on low (10 minutes). Using dough hook, knead remaining cup of flour until dough is smooth (another 5 minutes). Place on counter and cover with large metal bowl. Allow to rise until doubled (about one hour.). Cut dough into pieces about size of golf ball. Roll each ball out into "snake" about 10" long, then twist to form pretzel. Place each pretzel on floured kitchen towel and allow to rise 15 minutes. Bring 8-quarts of salted water to boil and gradually boil the pretzels, about 5 at a time, until they float (takes about a minute or so). Remove carefully with slotted spoon and place on a greased baking sheet. Bake until golden about 20 - 25 minutes. Can be frozen after baking.
Stovetop Method: Add chicken broth, shredded chicken, beans, salsa and cumin to a medium saucepan, and stir to combine.  Heat over medium-high heat until boiling, then cover and reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for at least 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nSlow Cooker Method: Add chicken broth, 2 (uncooked) *boneless skinless chicken breasts, beans, salsa and cumin to a slow cooker, and stir to combine.  Cook on low for 6-8 hours, or high for 3-4 hours until the chicken is cooked through and shreds easily with a fork.  Shred the chicken.
Place pasta, tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a large stock pot. Pour in vegetable broth. Sprinkle on top the pepper flakes and oregano. Drizzle top with oil.\r\n\r\nCover pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a low simmer and keep covered and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes or so. Cook until almost all liquid has evaporated – I left about an inch of liquid in the bottom of the pot – but you can reduce as desired .\r\n\r\nSeason to taste with salt and pepper. Add basil leaves and stir pasta several times to distribute the liquid in the bottom of the pot evenly throughout the pasta as you are serving. Serve garnished with Parmesan cheese.
Grease and flour two 8x4 inch pans. Preheat to 325 degrees.\r\n\r\nSift flour, salt, baking powder, soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl.\r\n\r\nBeat eggs, oil, vanilla, and sugar together in a large bowl. Add sifted ingredients to the creamed mixture, and beat well. Stir in zucchini and nuts until well combined. Pour batter into prepared pans. Cover with aluminum foil.\r\n\r\nBake for 40 to 60 minutes, or until tester in center comes out clean. Cool in pan on rack for 20 minutes. Remove from pan and fully cool before eating.
Grate your zucchini; we use the grating attachment on a mandolin, but if you don't have that you could use a grater. (The mandolin is much faster, of course. Or if you're an expert chopper, you could chop them finely as well!) Put the grated zucchini in a large bowl and add in the eggs and flour, then mix together (don't be afraid to use your hands for this part!) Stir/mix in some salt and pepper, and any additional add-in's of your choosing. My favorite is cayenne and diced red pepper.\r\n\r\nCoat a large wok or skillet with olive oil and heat on medium-low. Once heated, scoop out large spoonfuls (a hefty 1/4 cup or more) of the zucchini mixture onto the skillet. Cook until golden brown on each side, about 3-5 minutes per side depending on the size of the fritters and the temperature of your skillet. It's sort of like cooking pancakes! Add more oil to coat the pan as needed. Place the cooked fritters on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil before serving.\r\n\r\nI like to serve these with a big dollop of sour cream, and a side of red-skinned mashed potatoes. :)
